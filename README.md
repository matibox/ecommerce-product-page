## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SASS/SCSS
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   JS
-   [Glide.js](https://glidejs.com/)

### Useful resources

-   [Glide.js](https://glidejs.com/) - This JS library made sliders very easy to do. It also has its own API which I used in this project. For anyone looking for a slider library I would definetely pick this one!
